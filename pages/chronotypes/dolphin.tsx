        Of all the chronotypes, Dolphin is the hardest to create a set schedule
        around, since people with this chronotype tend to have trouble finding a
        sleep schedule that works for them. People with the Dolphin chronotype
        tend to be very intelligent, but also high-strung, sensitive sleepers
        who are often easily disturbed by noise or light. A Dolphin’s fragmented
        sleep patterns often overlap with symptoms of insomnia, which may or may
        not be indicative of the disorder itself. But there is good news for all
        the Dolphins out there! People with this chronotype have an excellent
        window of productivity— they tend to get things done between 10AM and
        2PM each day.
