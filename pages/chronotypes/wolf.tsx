        Odds are, we know someone who is not a morning person. These people
        almost certainly have the Wolf chronotype. People with the Wolf
        chronotype are most energetic waking up later in the day. They are most
        productive between noon and 4PM, and also get boosts of energy during
        the evening. I’m actually a Wolf chronotype myself. Working according to
        my body’s unique schedule makes it much easier to get everything I need
        done during the day, especially if a day is especially busy!
