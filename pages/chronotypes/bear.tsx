        This is the most common chronotype— about 55 percent of people
        have the Bear chronotype. People with this intermediate chronotype are
        generally most productive before noon, and begin feeling declines in
        energy in the late afternoon, and begin winding down for sleep in the
        early evening. The sleep-wake cycle of Bears is aligned with the sun, so
        it’s more natural for them to rise and set with the sun as well.
