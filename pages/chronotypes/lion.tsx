        “Early to bed, early to rise” is a good way to summarize this
        chronotype. People with the Lion chronotype tend to wake up early in the
        morning, and are most productive in the hours before noon. Lions are at
        their best when they can immediately get started with their day’s to-do
        list and get things done sooner rather than later. After finishing their
        day and winding down in the early evening, Lions tend to fall asleep
        early, usually by 9 or 10 PM.
